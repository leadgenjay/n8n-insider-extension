## About N8N Insider

N8N Insider is a Chrome extension that adds an AI-powered assistant to your n8n workflow editor. It understands your workflows visually through screenshots and can help you:

- Build new workflows from scratch
- Debug errors and issues

The extension works alongside n8n - it doesn't replace it. Think of it as having an n8n expert available 24/7 right in your browser.
