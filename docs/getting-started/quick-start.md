# Quick Start Guide

Get your first AI-powered workflow help in 2 minutes.

## Prerequisites

Complete these steps first:
- [Install the extension](/docs/getting-started/installation)
- [Set up OpenRouter API](/docs/configuration/openrouter-setup)

## Your First Conversation

### 1. Open n8n

Navigate to your n8n instance and open any workflow (or create a new one).

### 2. Open N8N Insider

Click the N8N Insider icon in your Chrome toolbar. The side panel opens on the right.

### 3. Ask a Question

Try one of these example prompts:

**For help with your current workflow:**
```
What does this workflow do?
```

**For building something new:**
```
How do I send an email when a form is submitted?
```

**For debugging:**
```
Why isn't my HTTP Request node working?
```

### 4. Get Contextual Help

N8N Insider automatically captures:
- A screenshot of your n8n canvas
- Your workflow structure (nodes, connections)
- The current page URL

This context helps the AI give you relevant, specific answers.

## Using Context Capture

### Automatic Capture
Every time you send a message, the extension automatically captures the current state of your n8n page.

### Manual Capture
Click the **camera icon** next to the input field to manually capture before typing your message. You'll see a blue indicator showing context is attached.

## Tips for Better Responses

1. **Be specific** - "Add a Slack node that sends a message" is better than "help with Slack"

2. **Reference what you see** - "The HTTP Request node on the left is returning an error"

3. **Ask follow-ups** - The AI remembers your conversation context

4. **Use Builder mode** - Connect your n8n API to let the AI make changes directly
