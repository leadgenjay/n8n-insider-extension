The entire process is triggered from a Google Sheet that acts as the central interface for input and output.\n\nIT automates video creation, uploading, and tracking, ensuring seamless integration between Google Sheets, Google Drive, Google Veo3, and YouTube.\n\nBenefits of this Workflow\n\n 💡 No Code Interface: Trigger and control the video production pipeline from a simple Google Sheet.\n ⚙️ Full Automation: Once set up, the entire video generation and publishing process runs hands-free.\n 🧠 AI-Powered Creativity:\n\n Generates engaging YouTube titles using GPT-4o.\n Leverages advanced generative video AI from Google Veo3.\n 📁 Cloud Storage & Backup: Stores all generated videos on Google Drive for safekeeping.\n 📈 YouTube Ready: Automatically uploads to YouTube with correct metadata, saving time and boosting visibility.\n 🧪 Scalable: Designed to process multiple video prompts by looping through new entries in Google Sheets.\n* 🔒 API-First: Utilizes secure API-based communication for all services.\n\nHow It Works \n1. Trigger: The workflow can be started manually (\"When clicking ‘Test workflow’\") or scheduled (\"Schedule Trigger\") to run at regular intervals (e.g., every 5 minutes). \n2. Fetch Data: The \"Get new video\" node retrieves unfilled video requests from a Google Sheet (rows where the \"VIDEO\" column is empty). \n3. Video Creation: \n - The \"Set data\" node formats the prompt and duration from the Google Sheet. \n - The \"Create Video\" node sends a request to the Fal.run API (Google Veo3) to generate a video based on the prompt. \n4. Status Check: \n - The \"Wait 60 sec.\" node pauses execution for 60 seconds. \n - The \"Get status\" node checks the video generation status. If the status is \"COMPLETED,\" the workflow proceeds; otherwise, it waits again. \n5. Video Processing: \n - The \"Get Url Video\" node fetches the video URL. \n - The \"Generate title\" node uses OpenAI (GPT-4.1) to create an SEO-optimized YouTube title. \n - The \"Get File Video\" node downloads the video file. \n6. Upload & Update: \n - The \"Upload Video\" node saves the video to Google Drive. \n - The \"HTTP Request\" node uploads the video to YouTube via the Upload-Post API. \n - The \"Update Youtube URL\" and \"Update result\" nodes update the Google Sheet with the video URL and YouTube link. \n\nSet Up Steps \n1. Google Sheet Setup: \n - Create a Google Sheet with columns: PROMPT, DURATION, VIDEO, and YOUTUBE_URL. \n - Share the Sheet link in the \"Get new video\" node. \n\n2. API Keys: \n - Obtain a Fal.run API key (for Veo3) and set it in the \"Create Video\" node (Header: Authorization: Key YOURAPIKEY). \n - Get an Upload-Post API key (for YouTube uploads) and configure the \"HTTP Request\" node (Header: Authorization: Apikey YOUR_API_KEY). \n\n3. YouTube Upload Configuration: \n - Replace YOUR_USERNAME in the \"HTTP Request\" node with your Upload-Post profile name. \n\n4. Schedule Trigger: \n - Configure the \"Schedule Trigger\" node to run periodically (e.g., every 5 minutes). \n\nNeed help customizing? \nContact me for consulting and support or add me on [Linkedin].","category":"AI & Automation","tags":["OpenAI","Google Sheets","YouTube","LinkedIn","HTTP Request"],"image_url":"https://yndcawdtkpqulpzxkwif.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/template-previews/previews/n8n-4846.png","file_path":"imported/n8n-4846.json","version":1,"active":true,"sort_order":0,"created_at":"2026-01-02T00:54:59.538079+00:00","updated_at":"2026-01-03T00:32:37.07462+00:00","has_documentation":true,"dfy_enabled":false,"dfy_price":null},

 {"id":"7ccdb94a-b83b-4d76-8c89-415b29c426b7","template_id":"n8n-5755","title":"Transform old photos into animated videos with FLUX & Kling AI for social media","description":"This workflow contains community nodes that are only compatible with the self-hosted version of n8n.\n\nDescription\n\nSee the transformation in action! Here's an example of what this workflow can achieve:\n\nThis automation template is designed for content creators, social media managers, and anyone looking to breathe new life into old family photos and historical images. It transforms any old black and white or sepia photograph into a colorized, animated video using cutting-edge AI technology, then automatically publishes the results across multiple social media platforms including Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, and X (Twitter).\n\nThe workflow combines powerful AI services to create engaging content from vintage photographs: first enhancing and colorizing the image using FLUX Kontext, then bringing it to life with realistic animations using Kling Video AI, and finally distributing the results across your social media channels automatically.\n\nNote: The estimated cost per workflow execution is approximately $0.29 USD, covering the AI processing for both image colorization and video animation. The upload-post node only works for self-hosted n8n instances, but you can use the standard HTTP request node for uploading content on n8n Cloud.\n\nWho Is This For?\n- Content Creators & Social Media Managers: Transform historical content into engaging videos that capture audience attention and drive engagement across platforms.\n- Family History Enthusiasts: Bring old family photos to life by adding color and motion, creating emotional connections with your audience.\n- Marketing Professionals: Leverage nostalgic content for brand storytelling, using vintage aesthetics to create compelling social media campaigns.\n- Digital Artists & Photo Restorers: Streamline the process of enhancing and sharing restored vintage photographs with automated AI enhancement.\n- Social Media Influencers: Create unique, eye-catching content from historical images that stands out in crowded social feeds.\n\nWhat Problem Does This Workflow Solve?\nCreating engaging social media content from old photos typically requires multiple manual steps: photo restoration, colorization, animation, and then individual posting to each platform. This workflow addresses these challenges by:\n- Automating Photo Enhancement: Uses advanced AI (FLUX Kontext) to automatically colorize and enhance old photographs, removing artifacts and improving quality.\n- Creating Dynamic Content: Transforms static images into animated videos using Kling Video AI, making historical photos come alive with natural movements.\n- Streamlining Multi-Platform Publishing: Automatically distributes the final animated videos across Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, and X with a single workflow execution.\n- Saving Time & Effort: Eliminates the need for manual photo editing, video creation, and individual social media posting.\n\nHow It Works\n1. Photo Upload: Users submit old photographs through a simple web form, with optional custom animation descriptions.\n2. Image Enhancement: The workflow uploads the photo to imgbb, then sends it to FLUX Kontext AI for colorization and quality enhancement.\n3. Animation Creation: The colorized image is processed AI to create a 5-second animated video with natural movements.\n4. Cloud Storage: The final video is automatically saved to Google Drive for backup and easy access.\n5. Multi-Platform Publishing: The animated video is simultaneously posted to Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, and X using the upload-post service.\n\nSetup\n1. FAL.AI API Key: Sign up at fal.ai and add your API key to the HTTP Request nodes for both FLUX Kontext and Kling Video AI services.\n2. ImgBB API Token: Create a free account at api.imgbb.com to get an API token for image hosting, then update the \"Upload Image to imgbb\" node.\n3. Google Drive Connection: Connect your Google Drive account to enable automatic video storage and backup.\n4. Upload-Post Service: Create an account at upload-post.com to get your API credentials for multi-platform social media posting.\n - Important: The upload-post node currently only works with self-hosted n8n instances. For n8n Cloud users, replace the upload-post node with standard HTTP request nodes to publish to each social media platform individually.\n5. Form Customization: (Optional) Modify the form fields in the \"Photo Upload Form\" node to collect additional information or customize the user experience.\n\nRequirements\n- Accounts: n8n, FAL.AI, ImgBB, Google Drive, upload-post.com\n- API Keys & Credentials: FAL.AI API Key, ImgBB API Token, Google Drive OAuth2, Upload-post.com API Token & User ID\n- File Types: Supports JPG, PNG image formats for photo uploads\n- Cost: Approximately $0.29 USD per workflow execution for AI processing\n\nTransform your old photographs into viral social media content with this powerful AI-driven workflow that handles everything from restoration to distribution automatically.","category":"AI & Automation","tags":["YouTube","Instagram","Facebook","HTTP Request","n8n"],"image_url":"https://yndcawdtkpqulpzxkwif.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/template-previews/previews/n8n-5755.png","file_path":"imported/n8n-5755.json","version":1,"active":true,"sort_order":0,"created_at":"2026-01-02T00:55:17.142049+00:00","updated_at":"2026-01-03T00:32:38.496513+00:00","has_documentation":true,"dfy_enabled":false,"dfy_price":null},

Each morning at 9 AM, it fetches all active campaign data including clicks, impressions, conversions, costs, and conversion rates from your Google Ads account.\n\nThe AI analysis engine evaluates four critical dimensions: CTR (click-through rate) to measure ad relevance, conversion rate to assess landing page effectiveness, cost per conversion to evaluate profitability, and traffic volume to identify scale-readiness. Each campaign receives a performance score (0-100 points) and is automatically categorized as Excellent (75+), Good (55-74), Fair (35-54), or Underperforming (0-34).\n\nHigh-performing campaigns trigger instant Slack alerts to your PPC team with detailed scaling recommendations and projected ROI improvements, while underperforming campaigns generate urgent alerts with specific optimization actions. Every campaign is logged to your Google Sheets dashboard with daily metrics, and the system generates personalized email reports—action-oriented scaling plans for top performers and troubleshooting guides for campaigns needing attention.\n\nThe entire analysis takes minutes, providing your team with daily intelligence reports that would otherwise require hours of manual spreadsheet work and data analysis.\n\nWho is this for?\n\n- PPC managers and paid media specialists drowning in campaign data and manual reporting\n- Marketing agencies managing multiple client accounts needing automated performance monitoring\n- E-commerce brands running high-spend campaigns who can't afford budget waste\n- Growth teams looking to scale winners faster and pause losers immediately\n- Anyone spending $5K+ monthly on Google Ads who needs data-driven optimization decisions\n\nSetup Steps\n\n- Setup time: Approx. 15-25 minutes (credential configuration, dashboard setup, alert customization)\n- Requirements:\n - Google Ads account with active campaigns\n - Google account with a tracking spreadsheet\n - Slack workspace\n - SMTP email provider (Gmail, SendGrid, etc.)\n\n- Create a Google Sheets dashboard with two tabs: \"Daily Performance\" and \"Campaign Log\" with appropriate column headers.\n- Set up these nodes:\n - Schedule Daily Check: Pre-configured to run at 9 AM daily (adjust timing if needed).\n - Fetch Google Ads Data: Connect your Google Ads account and authorize API access.\n - AI Performance Analysis: Review scoring thresholds (CTR, conversion rate, cost benchmarks).\n - Route by Performance: Automatically splits campaigns into high-performers vs. issues.\n - Update Campaign Dashboard: Connect Google Sheets and select your \"Daily Performance\" tab.\n - Log All Campaigns: Select your \"Campaign Log\" tab for historical tracking.\n - Slack Alerts: Connect workspace and configure separate channels for scaling opportunities and performance issues.\n - Generate Action Plan: Customize email templates with your brand voice and action items.\n - Email Performance Report: Configure SMTP and set recipient email addresses.\n\n- Credentials must be entered into their respective nodes for successful execution.\n\nCustomization Guidance\n\n- Scoring Weights: Adjust point values for CTR (30), conversion rate (35), cost efficiency (25), and volume (10) in the AI Performance Analysis node based on your business priorities.\n- Performance Thresholds: Modify the 75-point Excellent threshold and 55-point Good threshold to match your campaign quality distribution and industry benchmarks.\n- Benchmark Values: Update CTR benchmarks (5% excellent, 3% good, 1.5% average) and conversion rate targets (10%, 5%, 2%) for your industry.\n- Alert Channels: Create separate Slack channels for different alert types or route critical alerts to Microsoft Teams, Discord, or SMS via Twilio.\n- Email Recipients: Configure different recipient lists for scaling alerts (executives, growth team) vs. optimization alerts (campaign managers).\n- Schedule Frequency: Change from daily to hourly monitoring for high-spend campaigns, or weekly for smaller accounts.\n- Additional Platforms: Duplicate the workflow structure for Facebook Ads, Microsoft Ads, or LinkedIn Ads with platform-specific nodes.\n- Budget Controls: Add nodes to automatically pause campaigns exceeding cost thresholds or adjust bids based on performance scores.\n\nOnce configured, this workflow will continuously monitor your ad spend, identify opportunities worth thousands in additional revenue, and alert you to issues before they waste your budget—transforming manual reporting into automated intelligence.\n\nBuilt \n[Connect on LinkedIn]","category":"Messaging","tags":["Google Sheets","Slack","Discord","Gmail","Twilio"],"image_url":"https://yndcawdtkpqulpzxkwif.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/template-previews/previews/n8n-10174.png","file_path":"imported/n8n-10174.json","version":1,"active":true,"sort_order":0,"created_at":"2026-01-02T01:04:07.530056+00:00","updated_at":"2026-01-03T00:32:36.337129+00:00","has_documentation":true,"dfy_enabled":false,"dfy_price":null},

Instead of relying on expensive and time-consuming photoshoots, the system uses AI to generate realistic images of models wearing selected clothing items.\n\nThis n8n workflow automates the process of generating AI-powered virtual try-on images for a WooCommerce store. It fetches product data from a Google Sheet, uses the Fal.ai Nano Banana model to create an image of a model wearing the clothing item, and then updates both the Google Sheet and the WooCommerce product with the final generated image.\n\nAdvantages\n\n ✅ Cost Reduction: Eliminates the need for professional photo shoots, saving on models, photographers, and studio expenses.\n ✅ Time Efficiency: Automates the entire workflow—from data input to product update—minimizing manual work.\n ✅ Scalability: Works seamlessly across large product catalogs, making it easy to update hundreds of products quickly.\n ✅ Enhanced eCommerce Experience: Provides shoppers with realistic previews of clothing on models, boosting trust and conversion rates.\n ✅ Marketing Flexibility: The generated images can also be repurposed for ads, social media, and promotional campaigns.\n ✅ Centralized Management: Google Sheets acts as the control center, making it easy to manage inputs and track results.\n\nHow It Works\n\nThe workflow operates in a sequential, loop-based manner to process multiple products from a spreadsheet. Here is the logical flow:\n\n1. Manual Trigger & Data Fetch: The workflow starts manually (e.g., by clicking \"Test workflow\"). It first reads data from a specified Google Sheet, looking for rows where the \"IMAGE RESULT\" column is empty.\n\n2. Loop Processing: It loops over each row of data fetched from the sheet. Each row should contain URLs for a model image and a product image, along with a WooCommerce product ID.\n\n3. API Request to Generate Image: For each item in the loop, the workflow sends a POST request to the Fal.ai Nano Banana API. The request includes the two image URLs and a prompt instructing the AI to create a photo of the model wearing the submitted clothing item.\n\n4. Polling for Completion: The AI processing is asynchronous. The workflow enters a polling loop: it waits for 60 seconds and then checks the status of the processing request. If the status is not COMPLETED, it waits and checks again. This loop continues until the image is ready.\n\n5. Fetching and Storing the Result: Once the status is COMPLETED, the workflow retrieves the URL of the generated image, downloads the image file, and uploads it to a designated folder in Google Drive.\n\n6. Updating Systems: The workflow then performs two crucial update steps:\n It updates the original Google Sheet row, writing the URL of the final generated image into the \"IMAGE RESULT\" column.\n It updates the corresponding product in WooCommerce, adding the generated image to the product's gallery.\n\n7. Loop Continuation: After processing one item, the workflow loops back to process the next row in the Google Sheet until all items are complete.\n\nSet Up Steps\n\nTo make this workflow functional, you need to configure three main connections:\n\nStep 1: Prepare the Google Sheet\n Create a Google Sheet with the following columns: IMAGE MODEL, IMAGE PRODUCT, PRODUCT ID, and IMAGE RESULT.\n Populate the first three columns for each product. The IMAGE RESULT column must be left blank; the workflow will fill it automatically.\n In the n8n workflow, configure the \"Google Sheets\" node to point to your specific Google Sheet and worksheet.\n\nStep 2: Configure the Fal.ai API Key\n Create an account at [fal.ai] and obtain your API key.\n In the n8n workflow, locate the three \"HTTP Request\" nodes named \"Get Url image\", \"Get status\", and \"Create Image\".\n Edit the credentials for these nodes (named \"Fal.run API\") and update the Value field in the Header Auth to be Key YOURAPIKEY (replacing YOURAPIKEY with your actual key).\n\nStep 3: Set Up WooCommerce API\n Ensure you have the API keys (Consumer Key and Consumer Secret) for your WooCommerce store's REST API.\n In the n8n workflow, locate the \"WooCommerce\" node.\n* Edit its credentials and provide the required information: your store's URL and the API keys. This allows the workflow to authenticate and update your products.\n\nNeed help customizing? \nContact me for consulting and support or add me on [Linkedin].","category":"Data & Spreadsheets","tags":["Google Sheets","LinkedIn","HTTP Request","Gemini","Make"],"image_url":"https://yndcawdtkpqulpzxkwif.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/template-previews/previews/n8n-8022.png","file_path":"imported/n8n-8022.json","version":1,"active":true,"sort_order":0,"created_at":"2026-01-02T01:01:13.113317+00:00","updated_at":"2026-01-03T00:32:40.480155+00:00","has_documentation":true,"dfy_enabled":false,"dfy_price":null},

This solution automates importing, chunking, and indexing product manuals, then uses retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to answer user queries accurately and quickly with AI via WhatsApp messaging.\n\nWhat these workflows do\n\nWorkflow 1: Document Ingestion & Indexing\n\n- Manually triggered to import product documentation from Google Docs.\n- Automatically splits large documents into chunks for efficient searching.\n- Generates vector embeddings for each chunk using OpenAI embeddings.\n- Inserts the embedded chunks and metadata into a MongoDB Atlas vector store, enabling fast semantic search.\n\nWorkflow 2: AI-Powered Query & Response via WhatsApp\n\n- Listens for incoming WhatsApp user messages, supporting various types:\n - Text messages: Plain text queries from users.\n - Audio messages: Voice notes transcribed into text for processing.\n - Image messages: Photos or screenshots analyzed to provide contextual answers.\n - Document messages: PDFs, spreadsheets, or other files parsed for relevant content.\n- Converts incoming queries to vector embeddings and performs similarity search on the MongoDB vector store.\n- Uses OpenAI’s GPT-4o-mini model with retrieval-augmented generation to produce concise, context-aware answers.\n- Maintains conversation context across multiple turns using a memory buffer node.\n- Routes different message types to appropriate processing nodes to maximize answer quality.\n\nSetup\n\nSetting up vector embeddings\n\n1. Authenticate Google Docs and connect your Google Docs URL containing the product documentation you want to index.\n2. Authenticate MongoDB Atlas and connect the collection where you want to store the vector embeddings. Create a search index on this collection to support vector similarity queries.\n3. Ensure the index name matches the one configured in n8n (data_index).\n4. See the example MongoDB search index template below for reference.\n\nSetting up chat\n\n1. Authenticate the WhatsApp node with your Meta account credentials to enable message receiving and sending.\n2. Connect the MongoDB collection containing embedded product documentation to the MongoDB Vector Search node used for similarity queries.\n3. Set up the system prompt in the Knowledge Base Agent node to reflect your company’s tone, answering style, and any business rules, ensuring it references the connected MongoDB collection for context retrieval.\n\nMake sure\n\nBoth MongoDB nodes (in ingestion and chat workflows) are connected to the same collection with:\n\nAn embedding field storing vector data,\n\nRelevant metadata fields (e.g., document ID, source), and\n\nThe same vector index name configured (e.g., data_index).\n\nSearch Index Example:\n\n{\n \"mappings\": {\n \"dynamic\": false,\n \"fields\": {\n \"_id\": { \"type\": \"string\" },\n \"text\": { \"type\": \"string\" },\n \"embedding\": {\n \"type\": \"knnVector\",\n \"dimensions\": 1536,\n \"similarity\": \"cosine\"\n },\n \"source\": { \"type\": \"string\" },\n \"doc_id\": { \"type\": \"string\" }\n }\n }\n}","category":"AI & Automation","tags":["OpenAI","WhatsApp","MongoDB","GPT-4","Make"],"image_url":"https://yndcawdtkpqulpzxkwif.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/template-previews/previews/n8n-4827.png","file_path":"imported/n8n-4827.json","version":1,"active":true,"sort_order":0,"created_at":"2026-01-02T00:56:12.848353+00:00","updated_at":"2026-01-03T00:32:36.988499+00:00","has_documentation":true,"dfy_enabled":false,"dfy_price":null},

The agent doesn't just talk; it can use tools to perform actions and find information in real-time. This workflow is designed to show you exactly how that works.\n\n1. The Chat Interface (Chat Trigger): This is your window to the agent. It's a fully styled, public-facing chat window where you can have a conversation.\n2. The Brain (AI Agent Node): This is the core of the operation. It takes your message, understands your intent, and intelligently decides which \"superpower\" (or tool) it needs to use to answer your request. The agent's personality and instructions are defined in its extensive system prompt.\n3. The Tools (Tool Nodes): These are the agent's superpowers. We've included a variety of useful and fun tools to showcase its capabilities:\n Get a random joke.\n Search Wikipedia for a summary of any topic.\n Calculate a future date.\n Generate a secure password.\n Calculate a monthly loan payment.\n Fetch the latest articles from the n8n blog.\n4. The Memory (Memory Node): This gives the agent a short-term memory, allowing it to remember the last few messages in your conversation for better context.\n\nWhen you send a message, the agent's brain analyzes it, picks the right tool for the job, executes it, and then formulates a helpful response based on the tool's output.\n\nSet up steps\n\nSetup time: ~3 minutes\n\nThis template is nearly ready to go out of the box.

It works with both vertical and horizontal inputs and respects the original input resolution (no unnecessary upscaling), cropping or letterboxing intelligently when needed. The workflow automatically extracts between 3 and 6 clips (based on video length and the most engaging segments) and schedules one short per consecutive day—e.g., 3 clips → the next 3 days, 6 clips → the next 6 days.\n\nNote: This workflow uses OpenAI Whisper for word-level transcription, Google’s Gemini for clip selection and metadata, and Upload-Post’s FFmpeg API for GPU-accelerated cutting/cropping and social scheduling. You can use the same Upload-Post API token for both FFmpeg jobs and publishing uploads. Upload-Post also offers a generous free trial with no credit card required.\n\nWho Is This For?\n- Creators & Editors: Batch-convert long talks/podcasts into daily Shorts/Reels/TikToks.\n- Agencies & Social Teams: Turn webinars/interviews into a reliable short-form stream.\n- Brands & Founders: Maintain a steady posting cadence with minimal hands-on editing.\n\nWhat Problem Does This Workflow Solve?\nManual clipping is slow and inconsistent. This workflow:\n- Finds Hooks Automatically: AI picks 3–6 high-retention segments from transcript + timestamps (count scales with video length/quality).\n- Cuts Cleanly: Absolute-second FFmpeg timing to avoid mid-word cuts.\n- Vertical & Horizontal Friendly: Handles both orientations and respects source resolution.\n- Schedules for You: Posts one clip per day on consecutive days.\n\nHow It Works\n1. Form Upload: Submit your long video.\n2. Audio Extraction: FFmpeg job extracts audio for accurate ASR.\n3. Whisper Transcription: Word-level timestamps enable precise clipping.\n4. AI Clip Mining (Gemini): Detects 3–6 “viral” moments (15–60s) and generates titles/descriptions.\n5. Cut & Crop (FFmpeg): GPU pipeline produces clean clips; preserves input resolution/orientation when possible and crops/pads appropriately for target platforms.\n6. Status & Download: Polls job status and retrieves the final clips.\n7. Auto-Scheduling (Consecutive Days): Schedules one short per day starting tomorrow, for as many days as clips were produced (e.g., 3 clips → 3 days, 6 clips → 6 days) at a configurable time (default 20:00 Europe/Madrid).\n\nSetup\n1. OpenAI (Whisper): Add your OpenAI API credentials.\n2. Google Gemini: Add Gemini credentials used by the AI Agent node.\n3. Upload-Post (free trial no credit card required): Generate your api token https://app.upload-post.com/ connect your social media accounts and add your API token credentials in n8n (same token works for FFmpeg jobs and publishing).\n4. Scheduling: Adjust posting time/intervals and timezone (Europe/Madrid by default).\n5. Metadata Mapping: Titles/descriptions are auto-generated per platform; tweak as needed.\n\nRequirements\n- Accounts: n8n, OpenAI, Google (Gemini), Upload-Post, and social platform connections.\n- API Keys: OpenAI token, Gemini credentials, Upload-Post token.\n- Budget: Whisper + Gemini inference + FFmpeg compute + optional posting costs.\n\nFeatures\n- Word-Accurate Cuts: Absolute-second timecodes with subtle pre/post-roll.\n- Orientation-Aware: Supports vertical and horizontal inputs; preserves source resolution where possible.\n- Platform-Optimized Output: 9:16-ready delivery with smart crop/pad behavior.\n- Consecutive-Day Scheduler: 3–6 clips → 3–6 consecutive posting days, automatically.\n- Retry & Polling: Built-in waits and status checks for robust processing.\n- Modular: Swap models, adjust clip count/length, or add/remove platforms quickly.\n\nTurn long-form video into a consistent sequence of Shorts/Reels/TikToks—automatically, day after day, while respecting your source resolution.","category":"AI & Automation","tags":["OpenAI","YouTube","TikTok","Instagram","Gemini"],"image_url":"https://yndcawdtkpqulpzxkwif.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/template-previews/previews/n8n-9867.png","file_path":"imported/n8n-9867.json","version":1,"active":true,"sort_order":0,"created_at":"2026-01-02T00:55:38.767483+00:00","updated_at":"2026-01-03T00:32:41.167165+00:00","has_documentation":true,"dfy_enabled":false,"dfy_price":null},
